## [Play the game](https://2-dice-pig.netlify.app/)

## Overview

This project is a simple web application featuring the classic dice game, [Pig](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game)> 'Pig'), specifically the version known as 'Two-dice Pig.'

The inspiration came from one of the vanilla javascript projects in [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://codingheroes.io/ 'coding heroes')'s excellent Udemy course [The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/ 'The Complete Javascript Course') I highly recommend this course for anyone seeking to learn Javascript for the first time or use to brush up their skills.

The first version used React with vanilla JS ([here](https://stupefied-colden-eca4ca.netlify.app/ 'https://stupefied-colden-eca4ca.netlify.app/') is the original project). Then, I wanted a responsive UI and a computer opponent, so I decided to start from scratch and use a NextJS template including a [React](https://reactjs.org) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) + [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) + [RTK](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) + [eslint](https://eslint.org/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) [boilerplate](https://github.com/IsaiaPhiliph/vite-reactts-tailwind-rtk-eslint.git).
